Unfortunately, FIFA Street 3 was not released for PC, but only for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. However, there is a way to play it on your PC using an emulator. An emulator is a software that mimics the functions of another device or platform, allowing you to run games and applications that are not compatible with your system. In this case, you will need a PS3 emulator or an Xbox 360 emulator to run FIFA Street 3 on your PC.
 
One of the most popular and reliable PS3 emulators is RPCS3[^4^], which is an open-source project that aims to provide a high-quality emulation of PS3 games on Windows, Linux and BSD systems. You can download RPCS3 from its official website[^4^] or from its GitHub page. You will also need a PS3 BIOS file, which is a firmware that contains the basic functions of the PS3 system. You can find it online or dump it from your own PS3 console following the instructions on the RPCS3 website. After you have downloaded and installed RPCS3 and the PS3 BIOS file, you will need a copy of FIFA Street 3 for PS3. You can either buy it from an online store or download it from a ROM site such as ConsoleRoms[^1^]. Make sure you get the correct region version of the game that matches your PS3 BIOS file.
 
Once you have everything ready, you can launch RPCS3 and load FIFA Street 3 by clicking on File > Boot Game and selecting the game folder or ISO file. You may need to adjust some settings in RPCS3 to optimize the performance and compatibility of the game. You can check out some guides and tutorials on YouTube[^4^] or on the RPCS3 forums for more help. Enjoy playing FIFA Street 3 on your PC!

If you prefer to play FIFA Street 3 on an Xbox 360 emulator, you can use Xenia, which is another open-source project that aims to emulate Xbox 360 games on Windows and Linux systems. You can download Xenia from its official website or from its GitHub page. You will also need an Xbox 360 BIOS file, which is similar to the PS3 BIOS file. You can find it online or dump it from your own Xbox 360 console following the instructions on the Xenia website. After you have downloaded and installed Xenia and the Xbox 360 BIOS file, you will need a copy of FIFA Street 3 for Xbox 360. You can either buy it from an online store or download it from a ROM site such as ConsoleRoms. Make sure you get the correct region version of the game that matches your Xbox 360 BIOS file.
 
Once you have everything ready, you can launch Xenia and load FIFA Street 3 by clicking on File > Open and selecting the game folder or ISO file. You may need to adjust some settings in Xenia to optimize the performance and compatibility of the game. You can check out some guides and tutorials on YouTube or on the Xenia forums for more help. Enjoy playing FIFA Street 3 on your PC!
